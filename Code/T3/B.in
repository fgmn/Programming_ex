Dear David,
I have learned it from the internet that you want to make a Chinese friend to learn the Chinese language and culture. I am glad that you show such great interest in China and I would like to be your friend.
I will try my best to write to you as often as possible to introduce you the Chinese culture. When you have an opportunity to come to China, I will teach you how to speak Chinese and show you around some famous historical places of interest. Anyway, I am going to help you as much as I can. How do you think?
I am looking forward to your reply.
